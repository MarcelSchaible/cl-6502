MOAR UNIT TESTS! (opcodes+macrology)
Fix the sexp assembler/disassembler for more addressing modes. (x,y)
-- substitute #\. #\, and remove whitespace?
-- add support for * insert program counter in assembly/disassembly?
Improve the disassembler for browsing large ROMs. (i.e. Mega Man 2)

Ideas:
Write a high-level macro-assembler! (using defmacro and sexps, of course)
Define restarts for step?
-- Define the instruction.
-- Hand over a lambda to funcall/form to eval.

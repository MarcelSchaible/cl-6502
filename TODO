Fix!
-- Disasm-to-list of indirect+x,y code.
-- Can we clean up prefix-of/resolve. Maybe with cl-ppcre?
Extend!
-- add support for * insert program counter in assembly/disassembly?
Optimize!
-- A third of our allocations running Klaus' testsuite is in OVERFLOW-P.
-- Optimize status-bit% and generic-arithmetic calls CPU-time wise.
Improve the disassembler for browsing large ROMs. (i.e. Mega Man 2)

Ideas:
Write a high-level macro-assembler! (using defmacro and sexps, of course)
Define restarts for step?
-- Define the instruction.
-- Hand over a lambda to funcall/form to eval.
